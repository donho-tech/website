I started programming in school with Turbo Pascal which my Dad taught me. After graduating from Uni as a M.Sc. in
Applied Computer Science, I worked for several companies as a Software Engineer before becoming a Freelancer in 2017,
focusing on Java/Spring Boot projects with some degree of Typescript/React frontend development.

To me, software engineering is not only about programming and trying out the latest technologies but also about creating
maintainable and economically viable (read: pragmatic) solutions. Moreover, in my opinion communication and good team
work are more important for successful largish projects than having a team of so-called 10x developers which do not work
well together.

Besides being a programmer, I am a father of a lovely daughter, an enthusiastic Badminton player and a passionate
Karaoke singer.
